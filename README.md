This is our code to control a pick and drop robotic arm using an Arduino Uno. Our robotic arm has three degrees of freedom and it uses 4 MG995 Servo Motors. 
The pick-up is triggered using an LDR sensor. Since we have a fixed pick-up location, our LDR let's the UNO know whether or not an object is present at the location.
